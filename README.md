# MAINTAINING MY FAMILY LEGACY 

Culinary traditions are a big part of what makes each family unique. By keeping family recipes alive, we're not just preserving our own family traditions; we're also helping to protect a rich diversity of culinary and cultural heritage for future generations. The purpose of this project is to create a repository of my own family's culinary recipes. I hope to inspire others to do the same.
